""" A Python 3.10 example client for BeamGage Professional v6.21 or later

This module is intended as a client program for the purposes of utilizing the BeamGage Professional
Automation Interface.  The BeamGage Automation Interface is an API which interfaces with the BeamGage beam profiling
application.  This module does not provide direct camera API access and such access is not provided or supported with
Ophir brand beam profiling cameras.  Note that the bulk of laser beam profiling is performed in the beam profiler
application, not the camera, and direct camera access is not useful.  For custom machine vision applications
alternative products are available commercially.

The BeamGagePy wrapper class and all associated subclasses, enumerations, and example code are provided as-is
with no express guarantee or warranty of functionality and may be provided and updated independently of BeamGage
Professional releases.

This module may be adapted as needed without attribution.  Feedback or suggestions are welcomed for future versions.

The latest version of Ophir beam profiling software is available for download at:
https://www.ophiropt.com/laser--measurement/software-download

Professional tier licenses for Ophir brand beam profiling cameras may be purchased by contacting:

Todo:
    * Resolve functionality of event delegates that require arguments
    * Flush out inline documentation
    * Consider additional scenarios using more features and best practices
